                <p>The first and potentially most important decision regarding your case is choosing your attorney. 
                    My vast experience helps to choose a win-win strategy and solve the case with the maximum benefit for you. 
                    I represent my clients in legal proceedings in New York in family, administrative and property cases.</p>

                <p>When hiring a lawyer, each client expects help in inducing a court decision in his favor. 
                    This is the measure of the professionalism of a lawyer. For all my 20 years of law practice, 
                    I had only 5 lost cases. Even in the most hopeless cases, 
                    I try to help my client and honestly explain the chances that he has. 
                    In addition, according to my standard contract, 
                    I am ready to return my legal fee if I do not achieve the goal set.</p>
