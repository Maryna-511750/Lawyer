            <p>In favor of the plaintiff, $13,500 was recovered from the respondent surgeon for improperly performing cosmetic surgery for correcting the shape of the plaintiff’s nose.</p>
            <p class="cases-paragraph-hidden">The plaintiff claimed that she, as a patient, had entered into a contract with the surgeon, and he agreed to perform plastic surgery on her nose to increase her aesthetic appeal. The plaintiff's appearance didn't improve; in fact, her face was disfigured. I helped the woman receive compensation for her pain and suffering.</p>

            <p>On 04.03.2017, the Family Court of the State of New York satisfied the claims of attorney William Rhoades in the interests of the client about the deprivation of parental rights.</p>
            <p class="cases-paragraph-hidden">The court recognized that the father must be deprived of parental rights as he does not fulfill his obligations to the child in accordance with the norms of family law. It was a challenging case, but I proved that the presence of the father negatively affects the child, causing immediate aggression and psychological harm.</p>
